- Improved the Autonomy teamâ€™s current simulation environment by finding issues related to mismatched slam maps from using non-standardized timing formats amongst different ROS Nodes.
- Developed a simulated model of a 3-DOF gimbal camera and light system working with the ROS and Gazebo 9 for replicating the standard perception operation.
- Debugged issues related to the current autonomous perception solution being used for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and implemented suggested improvements.
- Created Emesents submission for the DARPA Subt Simulated challenge which involved redesigning the entire system for integration with the OSRF simulation using ignition Gazebo Dome and ignition transport instead of ROS.
